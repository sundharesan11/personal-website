## Routing

File-based via `src/pages`. Routes: `/` (Home), `/work` (Now/Work role feature), `/writing` (Writing index), `/writing/[lens]` and `/writing/[lens]/[slug]` (writing collection routes), `/reading` (compact reading list), `/iyal` (masthead-level active farmer-capital-network research/product page), `/contact` (general Web3Forms contact page with mail fallback), `/to` (future-desk index), `/ambitions` (alias to `/to` via a config redirect, no page file), `/to/agri-fintech`, `/to/sports-development`, `/to/waste-management`, `/modelling`, `/about`. The `/work/[slug]` project detail route was REMOVED along with the `projects` collection.

## Content model

`writing` frontmatter (see `src/content.config.ts`, the source of truth): `title`, `description`, `date`, `draft?` (true = hidden everywhere), `lens` (`economics | technical | theatrical`, lowercase), `status` (`published | writing`; `writing` = the being-written desk), `featured?` (surfaces on Home as "From this issue"), `cover?`, `link?` (external Medium piece: frontmatter-only file, no detail route).
`reading` frontmatter: `title`, `author`, `note`, `question?`, `status` (`read | on-deck`), `opened`, `cover?`, `link?`, `order`. Entries use descending manual `order`: the public `read` shelf is deliberately capped at the three current entries, shown under “Last three reads”; `on-deck` entries appear under To Read. Both sections use the existing detailed editorial list treatment when five or fewer entries exist; a longer To Read list can use the native disclosure on the same canvas. Read detail includes `note` and optional `question`; To Read detail includes `note` only. The index shows no counts or dates. Recommendations submit privately through Web3Forms, fall back to email when unconfigured, and become content only after manual curation.

Authoring workflow: `npm run new` scaffolds a schema-correct entry; `npm run publish` builds (zod gates every entry), commits, and pushes. See `docs/WRITING_WORKFLOW.md`.

Schemas enforced in `src/content.config.ts` with zod so content stays consistent. The `projects` collection and its schema were REMOVED.

Modelling is an intentionally hardcoded empty page at launch, not a content collection. Do not register a modelling collection until there is real modelling content to publish.

## Styling flow

Tailwind v4 (CSS-first): tokens are defined once in `src/styles/global.css` under an `@theme` block. Tailwind reads `@theme` and auto-generates utilities from those variables — there is no `tailwind.config.mjs`. Components use Tailwind utility classes (`text-accent`, `bg-surface`, etc.) that map directly to the `@theme` tokens. No raw hex/px in components.

Typography is tokenized in `src/styles/global.css`: `--font-serif` is Libre Bodoni for display, `--font-prose` is Source Serif 4 Variable for article prose, and `--font-sans` is Inter Variable for UI and scanning text. Special brand exception: `/iyal` uses `--font-script` (Sacramento via Fontsource) for the lowercase blue `iyal` wordmark only.

## Motion

CSS-first photo motion. Home uses `FixedPhotoHero.astro`: a frame-clipped fixed background on the portrait side of the hero, so the image stays visually fixed while scrolling but only paints inside the frame. The Home image side is wider than the text side and anchors the image right so the full portrait fits. Home uses `/img/hero-crop.jpeg`; About uses a dedicated `/img/about.jpg` portrait inside an inline 2:3 editorial frame. The About portrait frame and name/brief column stay sticky on desktop until the opening section gives way to the long-read, which preserves the scroll-hold effect without forcing the image through a viewport-fixed background crop. Other photo bands may use CSS parallax (`background-attachment: fixed` via Tailwind `bg-fixed`). Client JS stays narrow: `theme.ts` for themes, `cube.ts` for the rotating menu, `reveal.ts` for progressive reveal plus scroll progress, `sunflower.ts` for the page sunflower renderer, and `idleSunflowers.ts` for the three-second, reduced-motion-safe global decorative cluster. Idle flowers choose collision-checked random positions and spin slowly at varied speeds until interaction. Reveal is opt-in via `js-reveal` so content remains visible if JavaScript fails.

## Data flow

Fully static. No runtime data fetching at launch. Everything resolved at build time from content collections.
